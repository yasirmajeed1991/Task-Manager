In Excel, you can use the following steps to convert a date in the format "m/d/y h:i A" to "Y-m-d\TH:i":

Select the column containing the date values you want to convert.
Right-click the selection and choose "Format Cells" from the context menu.
In the "Format Cells" dialog box, select "Custom" under the "Category" list.
In the "Type" field, enter the following format code: "yyyy-mm-dd\Thh:mm"
Click "OK" to apply the new date format to the selected cells.
Alternatively, you can use a formula to convert the date format. Assuming your date is in cell A1, you can use the following formula in a different cell to convert the date:

=TEXT(A1, "yyyy-mm-dd\Thh:mm")

This formula uses the TEXT function to convert the date in cell A1 to the desired format.
